# Generative A.I.
Hyland has official [guidelines](https://pages.hyland.com/HRPortal/Policies/CONFIDENTIAL-INFORMATION-DATA-SECURITY-POLICIES/Information-Systems-Security-Policy-ISSP/Hyland-Generative-AI-Guidelines) about how to use generative A.I. in the workplace. Be sure to read the guidelines thoroughly before utilizing any type of A.I. tool.

There is also a [council](https://hyland.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GA/pages/875397256/Governance+-+Generative+AI) that governs the use of generative A.I. across Hyland.

## Approved Uses
Publicly-available GenAI tools (like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)) can come in handy. Some key use cases may be helpful for this project:

- Generate first drafts of materials for internal use (e.g., planning, presentations)
- Generate code or scripts strictly for internal use
- Conduct preliminary research (all of which must be verified)
- Assist with brainstorming ideas (for game design, code, or other things)
- Explain existing code in the codebase
- Provide guidance along the [learning paths](LearningPaths.md)

The key to A.I.-generated content is that it is only a starting point - everything must be double checked through a layer of human intelligence and ingenuity.

## Other A.I. Tools
There are [several approved tools](https://hyland.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GA/pages/928055311/Approved+Use+Cases) available, some of which may be more useful than others:

- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) (read the [Use Case Guidelines](https://hyland.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GA/pages/929927115/Microsoft+Copilot+Formerly+Bing+Chat) first)
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) (read the [Use Case Guidelines](https://hyland.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GA/pages/929765271/Github+Copilot+for+Business) first)

If you use anything that is generated by these tools, you should understand it at the same level as if you yourself wrote it. Several risks can arise, like low-quality code or security vulnerabilities - these will be mitigated by careful review of all generated content (by the generator and by other team members).

## Conclusion
Ultimately, A.I. can significantly enhance the efficiency of work processes - but be careful.
