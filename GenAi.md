# Generative A.I.
Hyland has official [guidelines](https://pages.hyland.com/HRPortal/Policies/CONFIDENTIAL-INFORMATION-DATA-SECURITY-POLICIES/Information-Systems-Security-Policy-ISSP/Hyland-Generative-AI-Guidelines) about how to use generative A.I. in the workplace. Be sure to read the guidelines thoroughly before utilizing any type of A.I. tool.

There is also a [council](https://hyland.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GA/pages/875397256/Governance+-+Generative+AI) that governs the use of generative A.I. across Hyland.

## Approved Uses
Approved uses of publicly-available tools are currently under review.

## Other A.I. Tools
There are [several approved tools](https://hyland.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GA/pages/928055311/Approved+Use+Cases) available, some of which may be more useful than others:

- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) (read the [Use Case Guidelines](https://hyland.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GA/pages/929927115/Microsoft+Copilot+Formerly+Bing+Chat) first)
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) (read the [Use Case Guidelines](https://hyland.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GA/pages/929765271/Github+Copilot+for+Business) first)

If you use anything that is generated by these tools, you should understand it at the same level as if you yourself wrote it. Several risks can arise, like low-quality code or security vulnerabilities - these will be mitigated by careful review of all generated content (by the generator and by other team members).

## Conclusion
Ultimately, A.I. can significantly enhance the efficiency of work processes - but be careful.
