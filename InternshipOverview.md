# Internship Overview
This page contains a big-picture introduction to the internship.

## Preface: Philosophy & Goals
Ultimately, your experience with this internship is up to you. Please let your own goals guide your approach. If you want to learn a lot about technology, feel free to explore some of the in-depth resources. If you care more about user experience, spend some time working on mockups or styling. If you want to see how real software teams work, focus on the project management aspect and ask a ton of questions. If you're business-minded, start thinking about how you might market the product you're building, or demo the software to stakeholders. Whoever you are, whatever you want to do, there will be opportunities throughout for you to choose your own path. Make the most of your time here, and have fun!

## What are we doing?
The team will be building an app called [HyTOP](ProjectInformation.md) - an online IDE for Hyland Tech Outreach programs. Team members will have to work together to make this project as successful as possible. Through this, you will have the opportunity to work with and learn:
