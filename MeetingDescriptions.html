                                <h1 id="meeting-descriptions">Meeting Descriptions</h1>
<p>Throughout the summer, there will be several meetings that serve a variety of purposes.</p>
<h2 id="daily-stand-up-meetings">Daily Stand-Up Meetings</h2>
<p>These meetings, occurring every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 10:30am, serve to assemble the team and ensure work is aligned across team members. Each team member should share:</p>
<ul>
<li>What they did during the previous day of work</li>
<li>What they plan to do today</li>
<li>What roadblocks they currently face or questions they currently have</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bi-weekly-checkpoint-meetings">Bi-Weekly Checkpoint Meetings</h2>
<p>These meetings serve as a checkpoint between the two-week blocks known as sprints. There are three parts crammed into one meeting:</p>
<h3 id="retrospective">Retrospective</h3>
<p>The team discusses the previous two weeks, and considers things that may improve their experience and effectiveness during the next two weeks.</p>
<h3 id="demo">Demo</h3>
<p>The team demonstrates their completed work from the previous two weeks.</p>
<h3 id="planning">Planning</h3>
<p>The team looks ahead and decides which issues to attack during the next two weeks.</p>
<h2 id="project-introduction">Project Introduction</h2>
<p>This meeting is intended to introduce the internship as a whole, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>This website</li>
<li>These meetings</li>
<li>Team processes &amp; roles</li>
<li>Issue tracking</li>
<li>Programming methods</li>
<li>Project details</li>
<li>Learning resources</li>
<li>First week goals</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of this meeting, interns should have a solid plan in place for work for the rest of the day and the next two days as well.</p>
<h2 id="code-walkthrough">Code Walkthrough</h2>
<p>The purpose of this meeting is to explain the many facets of the codebase at a high level. Up to this point, the interns may have been able to explore the codebase (and should have even updated it), but this will provide more context and background. Hopefully at this point they also have a relative familiarity with the technologies used in the project.</p>
<h2 id="ux-reviews">UX Reviews</h2>
<p>These meetings are meant to give interns an opportunity to think critically about the user experience of the application they are building. During the first instance, they should learn a bit about UX and its importance. From there, they should review the current state of the app, and discuss potential improvements (including wireframing new features if needed).</p>
<h2 id="usability-testing">Usability Testing</h2>
<p>These meetings are a chance for the interns to use the application, and see how it feels in its current state. They should take note of the overall user experience, look out for bugs, and discuss potential improvements.</p>
<p>One important piece of this may be to &quot;mock&quot; different use cases - for example, testing out different types of websites they might want to build, or different lessons or workshop material.</p>
<h2 id="branding-discussion">Branding Discussion</h2>
<p>This meeting will allow interns to consider the branding implications of the application. This is an opportunity for them to think a bit about the business/marketing side of software, as well as make decisions about the future work.</p>
<p>For this project, the goal of a solid brand identity is to ensure a cohesive experience and presence. This identity can help guide decision-making around the features, theming, and overall direction of the application.</p>
<h2 id="board-maintenance">Board Maintenance</h2>
<p>These meetings allow interns to clean up the GitHub Issues board. They should prune out-of-date issues, ensure all completed issues are moved to the proper place, organize the backlog in priority order, and do anything else to make the board nice.</p>
<p>This time will also be an opportunity for interns to blue sky brainstorm potential new features. Optimally, the board should always contain more issues in the backlog than can be completed within one sprint - but each issue should be feasible within one sprint.</p>
<h2 id="midsummer-demo">Midsummer Demo</h2>
<p>This meeting gives the team an opportunity to showcase the work they have completed thus far. It should encourage them to present a &quot;complete&quot; (MVP) version of their product. The main goal of the midsummer demo is to help them prepare for the final demo.</p>
<p>Stakeholders may be invited to the midsummer demo, but it should be a comfortable environment for the interns to practice presenting and show what they have.</p>
<h2 id="h2-planning">H2 Planning</h2>
<p>This meeting gives the interns a chance to think more long-term about the work that lies ahead. They should try to think about what they&apos;d like to accomplish by the end of the internship, given their present state. Ideally, they have a well-scoped plan of issues to complete during the latter half of the summer by the end of the meeting.</p>
<h2 id="final-presentation-preparation">Final Presentation Preparation</h2>
<p>The intern team can use this time to start putting together some slides.</p>
<p>As a group, the team should share:</p>
<ul>
<li>An explanation of the application &#x2013; its purpose and basic functionality</li>
<li>The processes the team followed to work together (things like stand-ups, planning, UX design, Kanban)</li>
<li>How the team leveraged different technologies to work on the project (things like Git, TypeScript, React)</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals should share:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their background (school, grade, programming experience)</li>
<li>What they learned throughout the internship</li>
<li>How this internship impacted them</li>
<li>Their favorite part of the internship</li>
</ul>
<p>This presentation should culminate in a demonstration of the current version of the application (deployed on Render so that attendees can see it for themselves). After that, the team can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss their future vision for the application</li>
<li>Share any closing thoughts about their experience</li>
<li>Ask if anyone has any questions</li>
</ul>
<p>If needed, refer to <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15rYigHrWHuWXscGACJ-2Kf6245mgUhLGUQmuD5EcD1E/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">the slides from 2023</a>.</p>
<h2 id="final-demo">Final Demo</h2>
<p>This presentation will be the &quot;end&quot; of the internship. The team should present what they built, talk about what they learned, and share any relevant insights about their experience.</p>
<p>Depending on the quality of the midsummer demo, it may be beneficial to invite leaders and/or executives to this final demo.</p>
