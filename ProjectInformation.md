# HYLAND TECH OUTREACH PORTAL (HyTOP)
_an online IDE for Hyland Tech Outreach programs_

## Description
This application will allow Hyland Tech Outreach students to create, store, edit, share, and host web-based code projects.

### Background & Motivation
For years, the Tech Outreach team has tried to find an online IDE that works. We have struggled immensely, especially because things change constantly. New features are added and old features are removed, price tiers shift, bugs pop up... it's hard to keep up. This project will be enormously helpful for our team, to help facilitate all of our programs effectively!

## User Experience
We do not need to do anything too creative when it comes to defining the user experience. We can basically copy what [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) or [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) or [Replit](https://replit.com) or [CodePen](https://codepen.com) or [JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) or [VS Code for Edu](https://vscodeedu.com) do - we just need to make it simpler, faster, and free-er.

### Essential Features
Some basic things we would like to have:

- Create websites with **index.html**, **style.css**, and **script.js** files
- Edit websites (if owned)
- Copy other people's websites
- HOST websites (actually allow people to view them as websites)
- Track a user's websites
- Good U.I. / strong brand

### Nice-to-have Features
These are some features that would be beneficial:

- Admin panel for classroom management
- Make new files in a project
- Fancy text editing features
- Built-in lessons

### Creativity
There will be several opportunities for creativity during this project. Many aspects exist beyond the actual coding:

- Art
- Design
- User Experience
- Marketing

Ultimately, the vision for the application will be determined by the intern team.
