# Summer Schedule
Here are the scheduled meetings for the summer. [Click here for descriptions of each meeting and more information about each of their respective purposes.](MeetingDescriptions.md)

#### Note: General Working Hours
The hope is that each intern will be generally available to work Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 9am-5pm throughout the summer.

Each working day, there will be a stand-up meeting starting at 10:30am.

## Week 1: 6/8-6/14
The goal for this week is for each intern to complete the **First Week Checklist**.

## Week 2: 6/15-6/21
The goal for this week is for development to begin in earnest. Each intern should try to create at least one new issue, should complete at least one issue, and should approve a pull request from a team member. _Note: Hyland is closed on **6/19** in observance of Juneteenth._

## Week 3: 6/22-6/28
The goal for this week is for the intern team to begin to function autonomously - that means they should be able to work well together without direct instruction from mentors. Mentors should still be available for assistance and guidance, but they should not dictate the development work. _Note: Y.O.U. has training on **6/25**._

## Week 4: 6/29-7/5
The goal for this week is for the team to continue their development. _Note: Hyland is closed on **7/4** in observance of Independence Day._

## Week 5: 7/6-7/12
The goal for this week is to continue development, with sights set on the end of the internship. _Note: Joseph will be attending the CSTA conference this week._

## Week 6: 7/13-7/19
The goal for this week is to continue development. _Note: Y.O.U. has training on **7/16**._

## Week 7: 7/20-7/26
The goal for this week is to continue development, and start preparing for the final demo.

## Week 8: 7/27-8/2
The goal for this week is continue development. The final presentation may take place during this week. Also, interns may reach their hour capacity around this time.

## Week 9: 8/3-8/9
The goal for this week is to finish the internship strong. Hopefully it will be possible to assemble the whole team for a final presentation during this week.
