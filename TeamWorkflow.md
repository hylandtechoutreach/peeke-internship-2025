# Team Workflow
When you're developing features or fixing bugs for the project, you'll want to follow the [trunk-based development workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development). A big piece of this will be working together to be as successful as possible.

## During Active Development
When the team is up and running, some processes should be followed.

### Programming Together
You are encouraged to practice [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) throughout their workdays. You could even try [mob programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming) if you'd like. Pair programming will help you:

- Learn more about the codebase
- Assure quality of the code written
- Impart wisdom and insights you may have
- Get to know your team members better
- Maintain the codebase effectively

If you are _not_ pair programming, you will need to make sure the whole team understands the code you are writing.

### Contributing to the Codebase
[Click here to learn how you can start contributing to the codebase.](ContributionGuide.md) As you follow these steps, please leverage your fellow interns for assistance - and leverage your mentors as well!

You can access the board with all the issues [here](https://github.com/orgs/hto-projects/projects/5).

## Autonomy
It will be up to you, as a team, to complete the necessary work for this project. Ideally, you will be fully autonomous; self-governing, without the need for any overarching authority. There will be some structures in place to help you function to the best of your ability, but ultimately, your success is up to you. You, as a team, have the power to dictate the vision and determine the path forward for the project. The job of the Hyland leads and mentors is simply to provide you the best available space to make your team dreams come true.
